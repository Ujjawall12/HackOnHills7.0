# Manhattan Web Interface# Welcome to your Lovable project



A modern web application for secure data erasure and sanitization operations, built with React and TypeScript.## Project info



## Overview**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/003990a0-4722-4599-a714-64bedec2a316



Manhattan Web provides a user-friendly interface for secure data erasure operations across various storage device types. All erasure methods are compliant with NIST SP 800-88 standards.## How can I edit this code?



## FeaturesThere are several ways of editing your application.



- **Multi-Device Support**: Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs), SATA SSDs, NVMe SSDs, and Traditional HDDs**Use Lovable**

- **NIST Compliant**: All methods follow NIST SP 800-88 guidelines

- **Modern UI**: Built with shadcn-ui components and Tailwind CSSSimply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/003990a0-4722-4599-a714-64bedec2a316) and start prompting.

- **Blockchain Integration**: Verifiable credentials for data destruction certificates

- **Comparison Tools**: Compare different erasure methods side-by-sideChanges made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.
